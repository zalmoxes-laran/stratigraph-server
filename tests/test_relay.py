"""P4.2 — the relay, proved with two WebSocket clients and no browser.

The eight claims the design asks for before anybody builds a client on top:

  1  FAN-OUT        an op from A reaches B, and does not echo back to A
  2  CONVERGENCE    concurrent ops → both copies land on the SAME canonical digest,
                    and it is the same answer the offline merge gives (same code)
  3  LATE-JOIN      a third client gets the snapshot + what it missed, and converges
  4  SNAPSHOT + GC  a forced snapshot is written to the store, the GC compacted it
                    WITHOUT changing the observable state, and the op-log is cut
  5  AUTH           no token → refused; with a token → the op's author is the
                    TOKEN's identity, not the one the client wrote
  6  PRESENCE       A joins → B sees it; A leaves → it is gone (ephemeral)
  7  THE RULES      the relay contains no convergence/GC logic (it calls the
                    library), and the durable truth is not the process's disk
  8  s3Dgraphy      its own suite is unchanged (measured there, not here)
  9  TOMBSTONES     the snapshot KEEPS the deletions (a client that joins without
                    them cannot converge, only resurrect) — the KEEP half of the
                    per-surface policy in `s3dgraphy.dissemination`

The three fences of P4.2 are asserted, not assumed: truth outside the process
(4, 7), convergence in the library (2, 7), presence ephemeral (6).

**One thing about the harness, because it looks like a bug and is not.**
Starlette's `TestClient` drives the app from the calling thread: the server task
that produced a frame only advances while the test is talking to *that* socket.
So after A sends an operation the test reads **A's `op_result` first** — which is
what lets A's handler finish, fan-out included — and only then B's copy. Against
a real uvicorn there is no such ordering; here, reading B first blocks forever on
a frame the server has not been given a chance to write.
