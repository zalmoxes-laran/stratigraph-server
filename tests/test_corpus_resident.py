"""The RESIDENT corpus: the documentation StratiGraph Server can read, so the rights bite.

The hole these tests close was measured on 17 Aug against the live stack: an
asset was uploaded to MinIO and its licence declared in a per-project corpus
**file**, and `GET …/asset/<ref>` still answered `x-em-license: null` — the
enforcement reads the rights out of a document the server holds, and a member of
somebody's em.json is not one.

What is defended here:

* **A · the register** — one corpus per instance, held by a store with the same
  discipline as a room snapshot: the three library acts append to it, `GET
  /v1/corpus` reads it, a **slice** by sha256 returns only what speaks about
  those files, the version is the CONTENT digest, and it survives a restart
  because the truth is in the store and not in the process;
* **A′ · the promote** — a project's file corpus **merges** into the resident one,
  per UUID, idempotently: offline is not a lesser mode;
* **B · the payment** — a licence declared in the resident corpus comes back in
  `x-em-license` (this is the header that was null), and an embargo declared
  there **refuses a viewer with the date** and serves an editor. Which is exactly
  what the file corpus could not do.
