"""An asset is served if the GRAPH says it may be — embargo, licence, authors.

`GET /rooms/{id}/asset/{ref}` had no gate: anybody holding a digest downloaded
the bytes. The digest is not a secret worth relying on either — it travels in
manifests and in documents — so "unguessable" was never the protection anybody
thought it was.

What these tests defend:

* an asset under a **running embargo** is refused to a viewer and to a stranger,
  and served to the people working on the study (**editor and above**);
* the verdict is computed from the DATE **at request time**, never from a stored
  flag: an embargo that expired this morning is over this morning;
* an asset the graph says nothing about is served **exactly as before** — a gate
  that changed the behaviour of every other file would have been a regression
  wearing a feature's clothes;
* the **licence travels with the bytes**, including the default, because a
  reader who has downloaded a file has been told what they may do with it;
* an embargoed image is **left out of the IIIF manifest**, which is what actually
  withholds it: the manifest is where a digest comes from;
* the gate **fails closed**: a document that will not read answers 503, never
  the bytes — "I cannot check" is not "there was nothing to check";
* and it cannot be walked around by naming **another room**, because the asset
  store is shared and the same picture can be cited in several studies.
