"""URL topology (internal ↔ public) and study visibility (public ↔ restricted).

Two rules that look like configuration and are really design.

**Every service→service URL has two forms.** The one this process dials
(`minio:9000`, `keycloak:8080`, `cantaloupe:8182` — names on the container
network) and the one it writes into documents other people's software will fetch
(`https://host/iiif/3`). Confusing them fails *opaquely*: a 403, an empty body, a
mixed-content block, a canvas with a placeholder size. Three separate bugs in
this project have been that same confusion, which is why `docs/URL-TOPOLOGY.md`
lists the pairs once and these tests hold the code to them.

**A manifest is a capability.** The image service has no auth of its own, and an
image is addressed by its sha256 — a digest that only the graph knows. So
serving the manifest of a study IS publishing its images, and the decision has
to belong to the study.
