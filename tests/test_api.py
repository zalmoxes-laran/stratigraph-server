"""StratiGraph Server's endpoints, and the properties that make it a *thin* wrapper.

Two things are worth testing in a service that is deliberately logic-free, and
they are not "does FastAPI work":

* **the answer is the library's.** `/export-ttl` must return exactly what
  `s3dgraphy.api.project_ttl` returns — byte for byte — because the moment the
  service reshapes a result, "the same API over HTTP" stops being true and two
  implementations start drifting. Same reasoning for the reprojection numbers.
* **a missing optional dependency is 501, never 500.** The request was valid and
  the build simply cannot do that op; a client can degrade honestly from a 501 and
  cannot from a 500.
