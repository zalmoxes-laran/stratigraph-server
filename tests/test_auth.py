"""P1 — the bearer-token gate, exercised against a locally signed realm.

No Keycloak here, and no mock of the verification either: a real RSA keypair is
generated, a real JWKS document is published (over ``file://``, which
``urllib.request`` fetches exactly the way it fetches ``https://``), and real tokens
are signed. What is faked is the *realm*, not the crypto — because the crypto is
the thing under test.

The end-to-end run against 3DR's actual realm is E.D.'s, and it needs the shared
configuration (see the mail to Romano). Everything that can be pinned without it is
pinned here, and these are the failures worth pinning:

* **the open fallback.** A deployment with a typo in one variable must not come up
  unprotected. Half-configured refuses to boot; that is the single most consequential
  line in `auth.py` and it gets its own test.
* **the algorithm confusion.** A verifier that honours the token's own ``alg``
  header lets the token choose how it is checked — ``alg: none``, or an HMAC signed
  with the public key. Both are refused before a key is even looked up.
* **401 vs 403.** "Go and get a token" and "your token is genuine but not for this
  service" are different instructions. Returning 401 for a wrong audience sends a
  client round a refresh loop that cannot help it.
* **the probe stays reachable.** If `/health` needed a token, a Docker HEALTHCHECK
  would report the service dead the moment auth was switched on.
