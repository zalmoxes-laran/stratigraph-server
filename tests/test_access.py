"""Who may enter a room, and who may write in it.

Until this, a valid token was a key to every room and to every operation in it.
These tests are the description of the door that replaced that, and each one
names a failure that would otherwise be invisible from the outside:

* a **viewer that can write** looks like a working room until somebody's edit
  arrives in a study they were only shown;
* a **refusal without a word** looks exactly like a dropped connection, so the
  room gets blamed for a rule it applied correctly;
* a **restricted study whose viewer may be anonymous** is a restricted study in
  name only;
* an **admin who may touch an owner** is an admin who may take the room.

The relay is driven through the real `TestClient`, with the authenticator forced
into enforcing mode and `verify` returning the claims we choose — everything but
the signature check is the production path, which is where the interesting
mistakes live.
