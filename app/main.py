"""StratiGraph Server — the s3Dgraphy access API, over HTTP.

**P0: read-only, local, no auth.** Auth (Keycloak), assets (MinIO), the WebSocket
op-log and the deployment on the shared infrastructure are P1–P4, and they land
with 3DR. Nothing here anticipates them beyond leaving the seams where they go.

The architectural rule this file exists to honour: **FastAPI lives only in
StratiGraph Server.** s3Dgraphy stays a pure library — no web framework, no transport — and
this is a *thin adapter* over `s3dgraphy.api`. There is no new logic here, and
there must not be: if an endpoint needs to compute something, that something
belongs in the library, where it is testable without a server and reusable by
EMStudio's local bridge, by EMtools, and by EMLab.

**The contract is em-bridge's.** EMStudio already speaks to a local sidecar
(`EMStudio/tools/em_bridge.py`) with exactly these payloads; StratiGraph Server answers the
same shapes so the frontend's `bridgeUrl()` can point here instead, with nothing
else changed. Where the two differ it is stated in the endpoint's docstring.

**Stateless (12-factor).** No session, no upload directory, no database: a document
arrives in the request and leaves in the response. That is what makes it safe to
run several replicas behind a load balancer, and it is a property to defend rather
than an accident — the first endpoint that keeps a file on disk breaks it.

**Everything lives under `/v1`.** The prefix is not decoration: 3DR will build
against this contract, and a path is the cheapest promise to keep. `/v1` means the
route names and payloads of P0 do not move; the multi-client WebSocket work of P3
may well need a `/v2`, and it should be able to appear beside this one rather than
replace it.

The single exception is `GET /health`, which exists **unversioned as well**. A
health probe belongs to the infrastructure, not to the API: a Docker HEALTHCHECK, a
Kubernetes liveness probe and a Caddy upstream check should not have to be edited
the day the API version changes. `/v1/health` is the API's answer, `/health` is the
orchestrator's, and they return the same thing.

# what would make `*` dangerous, and nothing here needs it.

# Taking the canvas out of the manifest withholds the digest — which is real,
# because the manifest is where a digest comes from — but somebody who already
# has the hex reaches the image directly. That is the hole this closes.
#
# The shape: the proxy in front of the image server asks StratiGraph Server first
# (`forward_auth`), for every `/iiif/*` request. StratiGraph Server stays the authority —
# it is the process that can read the graph, resolve the room's ACL and apply
# exactly the rule the asset route applies. Cantaloupe keeps knowing nothing
# about rights, which is right: an image server should serve images.
#
# The alternative was a Cantaloupe DELEGATE script (Ruby, calling back here).
# Rejected for two reasons: it puts a second implementation of the rule in a
# second language inside a component whose job is not authorisation, and it is
# invisible to anybody reading the routing — the place people look when they ask
# "who can reach this". `forward_auth` is one stanza in the file that already
# decides what reaches what.

# ── URL topology · one house for internal↔public ─────────────────────────────
#
# Every service→service URL in this deployment has TWO forms, and confusing them
# fails opaquely — a 403, an empty body, a mixed-content block. The pairs are
# listed once in `docs/URL-TOPOLOGY.md`; the rule is one line:
#
#     StratiGraph Server SPEAKS on the internal form and WRITES the public form into the
#     documents it serves.
#
# `EM_IIIF_PUBLIC` is what goes into a manifest (other people's viewers fetch
# it, so it must name a host they can reach). `EM_IIIF_INTERNAL` is how this
# process reaches the same image server to read `info.json` — inside a compose
# network `localhost` is StratiGraph Server itself, so using the public form here
# measures nothing and every canvas silently gets a placeholder size.
#
# The older `EM_IIIF_BASE` / `EM_IIIF_INTERNAL_BASE` spellings are still read, in
# that order: one setting with two names and a precedence, never two settings
# that will one day disagree.
#
# And the rule has a HARD half, which is the one a request can attack:
#
#     the address StratiGraph Server DIALS comes only from the CONFIG.
#
# A request parameter may, at most, change the URL WRITTEN INTO the document it
# gets back. Never the outgoing call. The two are easy to conflate because they
# name the same service — that conflation is exactly what `?image_base=` did
# (`internal = IIIF_INTERNAL or base`, so a deployment with no IIIF configured
# dialled whatever host the caller named), and it is why this is now stated
# rather than assumed. `_measure_images` refuses an unconfigured base for the
# same reason: no address is a fact to report, not a gap for a caller to fill.

    The graph is the source and the manifest is a view of it — built by
    `s3dgraphy.api.iiif_manifest`, because that is where the logic belongs
    (rule #1). What StratiGraph Server adds is the two things a library must not do:

    * it knows the deployment's **public** Image API base;
    * it can **fetch `info.json`** to learn each image's pixel size. A library
      that made HTTP calls would be untestable and would break offline; a server
      that refused to would emit canvases with placeholder dimensions.

    **Public or restricted, per STUDY** (the tiers of D2.2 §3.4). A room whose
    document says `header.visibility: "public"` is the *dissemination* tier —
    validated work, meant to be read by anybody — so its manifest is served
    **without a token**: that is what publishing means. Anything else is
    in-progress and stays behind the token, which is also the DEFAULT, because a
    study served too openly cannot be un-served.

    What the gate actually protects is worth stating, because it is not obvious:
    the image service (Cantaloupe) has no auth of its own, but an image is
    addressed by its **sha256**, and the only place a digest comes from is the
    graph. **The manifest is the capability.** Refuse it and a restricted study's
    assets are unguessable; serve it and you have published them — which is why
    the decision lives with the study rather than in a config file.

    The token may arrive in the header (a program) or in the query (a VIEWER):
    Mirador fetches this URL itself and cannot be asked to set a header, and
    refusing the query would mean no IIIF viewer could open one of our manifests.
