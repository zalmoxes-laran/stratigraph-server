"""P1 — OIDC bearer-token auth against the shared Keycloak realm.

StratiGraph Server is a **resource server**: it never logs anybody in. A client obtains an
access token from Keycloak (Heriverse-Server already does the authorization-code
dance for its own users) and presents it here as ``Authorization: Bearer <jwt>``.
This module answers one question per request — *is this token good, and is it for
us* — by checking the signature against the realm's published JWKS.

**Why a resource server and not a login flow.** Two services validating the same
realm's tokens share their users, groups and revocations for free, with no session
store on either side. The moment StratiGraph Server kept a session it would stop being
horizontally scalable, which is the 12-factor property `main.py` exists to defend.

**Configuration reuses what 3DR already deploys.** Heriverse-Docker sets
``TOKEN_ENDPOINT`` (``…/realms/<realm>/protocol/openid-connect/token``) and
``CLIENT_ID_<app>``. Rather than asking for a second spelling of the same realm
URL — the classic way two configs drift until one is wrong — the issuer and the
JWKS URI are DERIVED from that endpoint when they are not given explicitly. A
deployment that already runs Heriverse can point StratiGraph Server at the same realm
without inventing a variable.

**Three states, and the middle one is the point:**

* **enforcing** — issuer and audience known: every ``/v1`` route needs a valid
  token.
* **dev / no-auth** — *nothing* OIDC is configured: P0 keeps working locally, with
  a loud warning in the log AND in ``/health``, because a warning nobody reads is
  not a warning.
* **misconfigured** — *some* of it is set and some is not: the process **refuses to
  start**. This is the state that matters. A half-configured deployment that fell
  back to open would be a service everyone believes is protected, and that failure
  is silent, permanent, and discovered by the wrong person.
