"""The relay: `/v1/rooms/{id}/ws` — StratiGraph Server as "just another host".

It speaks **the wire that already exists** (ADR-002: `snapshot`, `op`,
`host_info`, `select`, `command`). That is the whole trick of this step: when
EMStudio points at an StratiGraph Server it does not need a new protocol, because the
relay is a host that happens to have several clients instead of one.

**WIRE 2 · the body travels nested.** The envelope is `{v, type, source,
graph_id?}` and everything type-specific is inside `payload` — see `wire.py` for
the bug that taught us why. The consequence here is the important one: for an
`op` the relay treats the payload as **opaque**. It stamps the author, it dates
it, it hands it to the library and it forwards it verbatim. It never reaches
into it for a field, so no word of the body can ever collide with a word of the
wire again (an edge's `source` used to be eaten by the envelope's).

What the relay does with an operation is **apply it through s3Dgraphy and pass it
on**. It does not transform, order or reconcile anything: the CRDT of P4.1
converges whatever the order, which is precisely why a *relay* is enough and an
operational-transform server is not needed. If this file ever grows a merge rule,
the rule is in the wrong repository.

Authentication: the connection carries a token, verified with the same
`app/auth.py` the HTTP routes use. The **author of every operation is the token's
identity**, never what the client wrote in the message — an author a client can
declare is an author anybody can borrow, and P4.1b made the stamp the thing the
merge trusts.
