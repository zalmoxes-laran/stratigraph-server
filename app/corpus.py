"""The RESIDENT DTC corpus: this instance's documentation, where StratiGraph Server can read it.

## The hole this closes (measured, 17 Aug 2026)

An asset was uploaded to MinIO and its rights were declared in a **file** corpus —
the per-project `DTCCorpus` member that travels inside an em.json. Serving the
asset, `GET …/asset/<ref>` answered `x-em-license: null`: the enforcement reads
the rights from the **room's document**, and a file on somebody's laptop is not a
document StratiGraph Server has. The licence was written, and the server could not see it,
so it did not bite.

So the corpus gets a residence. One per **instance** — the shared register of the
documentation, the way the Catalog is the shared register of studies — held with
the same discipline as a room snapshot: put atomically, outside this process,
rebuildable. It is a place StratiGraph Server can *ask*, which is the whole point.

## Why per-instance and not per-room

A digest is content, and the same photograph is cited by several studies (that is
why `_rights_seen_anywhere` exists at all). The provenance of a file is a fact
about the file, not about the room somebody happened to open — so partitioning
the corpus by room would make one file's licence depend on which door you came
through, which is the bug this closes, re-introduced one level up.

## What it holds

**One em.json graph section**, marked as a corpus
(`data.em_collection = "DTCCorpus"`) — the same shape the per-project member has,
so the two are the same kind of thing and the promote path is a merge and not a
translation. Its nodes are acquisitions, transformations and the resources they
are about; the resources carry their `checksum`, which is what the asset gate
looks them up by.

## Versioning

**Append-mostly, versioned by CONTENT.** Every write recomputes a sha256 over the
canonical JSON, so the version measures what the corpus *says*, not how many
times somebody pressed save — the same rule the project version follows
(`s3dgraphy.container.bump_version`). No history and no branches tonight: those
are a design decision about citing a state of the documentation, not a store
feature, and inventing them here would prejudge it.

## Offline keeps working

The per-project file corpus is NOT replaced: standalone/offline it is the truth,
it travels with the em.json, and at promote/join its DTC **merges** into the
resident one (`s3dgraphy.dtc.corpus.merge_corpus`, per-UUID, additive). Two
places, one shape, and the resident one is what the server can enforce from.
