"""The asset store: a room provides a graph AND the bytes it refers to.

P4.2 gave a room its graph (the snapshot store). This is the other half: a study
is not only a set of assertions, it is also the models and the photographs those
assertions point at, and a room that could hold the first without the second
would push every collaborator back to sending files by hand.

Same shape as `store.py`, and for the same reason: **the durable truth is not on
the process's disk.** The interface is three methods, the implementation for
tests keeps bytes in memory, and the production one is MinIO — a line of
configuration, not a rewrite.

**Content-addressed.** The reference IS the digest of the content
(`sha256:<hex>`), which buys three things at once and no cleverness:

* **dedup is free** — the same bytes put twice are one object, because they have
  the same name. Two people who promote the same model do not fill a bucket.
* **the reference is verifiable** — a client that fetches an asset can check what
  it got, without asking anybody. That is what makes `checksum` on a ResourceNode
  a fact rather than a hope.
* **immutability** — an object cannot be replaced under a reference that still
  points at it. A citation stays a citation.

The digest travels WITH its algorithm (`sha256:…`), the same rule the shelf's
checksum follows: a bare hex string is unreadable in two years.
