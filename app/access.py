"""Who may do what in a room — roles, the per-room ACL, and how a role is resolved.

Until now the relay **authenticated** and stopped there: any valid token entered
any room and wrote to it. Authentication answers *who are you*; this module
answers *what may you do here*, and the two are not the same question. Keycloak
does the first. **StratiGraph Server does the second** — deliberately, because the
authorisation is about a study this server holds, not about an identity provider.

## The four roles

* **owner** — everything, including the other admins, the transfer of ownership
  and the deletion of the room;
* **admin** — manages editors and viewers and the room's resources, edits;
  never touches the owner or another admin;
* **editor** — reads and writes the graph, adds resources, bakes; manages nobody;
* **viewer** — reads. Snapshot and presence yes, operations **refused with a
  reason** — a silent drop looks exactly like a network fault.

They are ordered, so a permission question is a comparison
(``role >= Role.EDITOR``) rather than a list of names to keep in sync.

## Where each half lives, and why it is a split

The **owner is intrinsic to the study**: it comes from the container's header,
travels with the file, and survives being restored on another server. The
**collaboration roles are operational**: who may edit *this room on this server*
is not a scientific fact about the excavation, and writing it into the em.json
would put an access-control list inside the record of what was found. So:

* owner → `header.owner` (an ORCID), with the first authoring ORCID as the
  fallback the study already carries;
* everybody else → an ACL **beside** the snapshot, keyed by ORCID, with the same
  discipline `store.py` uses: atomic write, the file is the truth, the process
  holds a cache.

## Visibility, embargo, and the two kinds of viewer

A **public** study is readable by anyone, including somebody with no token at
all: that is what publishing means. A **restricted** study has viewers too, but
a viewer there is *login + explicit grant* — authenticated without a grant is a
refusal (4403), no token at all is a refusal (4401). The distinction is the
whole point: "viewer" is not one thing.

An **embargo** is a temporal gate over exactly that: while the date is in the
future the study behaves as restricted whatever its declared visibility, and
when it passes the study goes back to what it says it is. One rule, so the
Catalog's listing and the room's door cannot drift apart.

## Groups: built, ON TOP of the per-ORCID ACL

A named **group** of ORCIDs can hold a role in a room's ACL, and the registry of
who is in which group lives here too (`Groups`). It takes nothing away from the
foundation: a grant to a person is still a grant to a person, and the two are
read together. The resolution is one word — **the maximum** — which is a
comparison rather than a table of cases because the roles are ordered, and which
is the only safe direction: if the individual grant always won, adding somebody
to the excavation team would silently demote them.
