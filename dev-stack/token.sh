# Nothing but the token goes to stdout — every message here is on stderr — so it
# pipes into anything without a `grep` to clean up after it. The values come from
# `.env.dev`, and they are the SAME grant `smoke.py` uses: if the smokes can get
# a token and this cannot, the difference is the realm, not the script.

token.sh — a dev access token from the local Keycloak realm.

    ./dev-stack/token.sh              print the access token (user: dev)
    ./dev-stack/token.sh | pbcopy     …and put it on the clipboard
    ./dev-stack/token.sh --user viewer
                                      a token for another seeded user. `viewer`
                                      is an ordinary authenticated identity with
                                      no room membership — which is what an
                                      embargo gate refuses (403). The password
                                      is the username unless DEV_PASSWORD says
                                      otherwise
    ./dev-stack/token.sh --claims     print the token's claims instead (aud, iss,
                                      preferred_username, expiry) — the three
                                      things worth looking at when a room says 4401

Reads KEYCLOAK_PORT / DEV_REALM / DEV_CLIENT_ID / DEV_CLIENT_SECRET / DEV_USER /
DEV_PASSWORD from dev-stack/.env.dev; the environment wins over the file.

The token is short-lived by design (the dev realm issues minutes, not days). When
a room stops accepting it, run this again — that is the expiry, not a fault.
