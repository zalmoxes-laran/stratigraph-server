# The dev realm

`realm-em-dev.json` is imported by the dev-stack Keycloak at start-up. Everything
in it is a **development** credential and none of it is ever a production one:
the real realm is the shared Keycloak the Ansible role points at.

**The file itself carries no comments on purpose.** Keycloak's importer
deserializes strictly and refuses an unknown key — a `_comment` field at the top
stops the container from starting, with a Jackson stack trace that says nothing
about realms. So the explanation lives here.

What it seeds, and why each piece is needed to get a token with `curl`:

| piece | why |
|---|---|
| realm `em-dev` | the isolated realm this stack validates against |
| client `em-server` | confidential (`em-dev-secret`), **service accounts ON** so `client_credentials` works, **direct access grants ON** so a password grant works too — which is what a human uses |
| mapper `audience` | **the one that is always missing.** Without it the token's `aud` is `account`, and StratiGraph Server answers `403 … issued for another client`. It is the single most common reason a correct-looking token is refused |
| mapper `orcid` | puts the user's ORCID iD in the token, so the room stamps an identity (`_identity()` in `app/ws.py` reads `orcid` first) instead of leaving edits unsigned |
| user `dev` / `dev` | the human; carries the ORCID attribute. Bootstraps as the **owner** of any room they are the first to join |
| user `viewer` / `viewer` | a second, ordinary authenticated identity with **no** membership anywhere. Added 2026-08-17 for the embargo end-to-end (`dev-stack/smoke_embargo_viewer.py`): the gate refuses anybody below editor, and with one user in the realm there was nobody to be refused — the 403 could only be measured against a stand-in. Its ORCID is a different one, so a room can tell the two apart |

No custom scope is required, so `OIDC_REQUIRED_SCOPE` stays unset.

Changing any of this means changing **this file**, not only `.env.dev`: the env
file selects which realm/client to ask for, the JSON is what actually exists.

**And a change here needs a RE-IMPORT.** Keycloak runs `start-dev
--import-realm`, which imports only when the realm is not already in the
container's own database — so editing this file changes nothing until the
container is recreated:

    cd dev-stack && docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.dev \
        up -d --force-recreate keycloak

The re-import mints **new realm keys**: every token issued before it stops
verifying. That is expected, and it is why a room that suddenly answers 4401
right after a realm change is not a bug — ask for a token again.
