"""End-to-end smoke of the dev stack — the proof that MinIO is REAL.

Everything below could be faked by a server that kept the bytes in a dict, and
that is exactly what this script is written to rule out. So it does not only ask
StratiGraph Server whether it stored something: it **opens the bucket itself** and looks.

    python dev-stack/smoke.py            # after `docker compose … up -d`

What it checks, in order, and what each one would catch:

1. **a token** from the dev realm — if this fails the realm import is wrong, and
   nothing after it means anything;
2. **PUT** an asset → the reference is the sha256 of the bytes we sent (a store
   that invented its own name would show up here);
3. **the object is in MinIO**, verified against the bucket directly, and its size
   and content-type are read with a `head` that does not download it;
4. **GET** returns the same bytes, byte for byte;
5. **no token → refused**, and nothing is stored;
6. **promotion** (DP-76): `s3dgraphy.api.promote_resource` with the URL StratiGraph Server
   serves → the ResourceNode becomes a `reference` carrying that url + checksum,
   **and that url really serves those bytes**. This is the arc: the model leaves
   the .blend, lands in the object store, and the graph points at it.

Exit code 0 = everything measured. Anything skipped is printed as SKIPPED with
the reason — a smoke test that hides what it could not do is worse than none.

#: The dev stack's Caddy uses an INTERNAL CA, and this helper had no TLS context
#: until 2026-09-19 — because until then nothing it fetched was https on that CA.

#: What changed: `EM_IIIF_PUBLIC` moved from Cantaloupe's direct port to the
#: node's front door, so a manifest's image URL is now
#: `https://em.localhost:8443/iiif/3/…`. `smoke_iiif.py` fetches exactly that URL
#: to check that «the image the canvas paints really resolves», and it came back
#: as 112 bytes of
#:
#:   [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get
#:   local issuer certificate
#:
#: The CHECK was right and the HELPER could not reach the thing. `smoke_common.py`
#: had already solved this, and its reasoning is borrowed rather than reinvented:
#: «a smoke that refused to talk to it would be a smoke nobody runs; the
#: certificate is the operator's own, on their own machine».
